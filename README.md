Object Recognition using Furniture dataset

Synopsis

1.	Introduction

Many problems in computer vision were saturating on accuracy before a decade. However, with the rise of deep learning techniques, the accuracy of these problems drastically improved. Deep Learning is becoming a very popular subset of machine learning due to its types of data.

One of the major problems was of object classification. It is the task of classifying objects from different object categories. The more complicated problem of object detection involves both classification and localisation. The simple formulae of object classification are object classification=localisation+ classification. Object classification is a critical task in computer vision applications. 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is one of the variants of neural networks used heavily in the field of Computer Vision. It derives its name from the type of hidden layers it consists of. The hidden layers of a CNN typically consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and normalization layers. It is a great method to use deep learning. Deep Learning is becoming a very popular subset of machine learning due to its high level of performance across many types of data. The Keras library in Python makes it pretty simple to build a CNN.

2.	Objective

The main aim of our project is to write a code that recognizes and labels the object in the image. The objective of object recognition is, from the incoming image, to find a series of data of the same class in a set of training images in a database. It is for better and clearer understanding of the working of the object recognition algorithm.


3.	Proposed Method

In this project, the classification model of furniture (5 classes) is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

	5.	Briefing 

In this project, we first read all the images from the dataset and train the code on them along with keeping their labels in check. Secondly optimizers are been used to minimize the redundancy if any produced during the process. CNN algorithm is used for filtering out each and every corner for better accuracy, precision and f1 score.
